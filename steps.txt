Add the origin "git remote add origin https://github.com/aniket199719/ML-Project.git"

Check the sync using "git remote -v"

To push data into git repo "git push -u origin main" 
    NOTE: If doing push for the first time you will have to set "git global"using below cmds

In "exception.py" import sys package (The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. It allows operating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.)
